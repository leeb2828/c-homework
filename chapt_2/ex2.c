/*
Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a 10-meter
radius, using the formula v = 4/3Ï€r^3 . 

Write the fraction 4/3 as 4.0f/3.0f. (Try writing it as 4/3. What happens?) 
Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to 
multiply r by itself twice to compute r^3.

Afterwards, modify the program so that it prompts the user to enter
the radius of the sphere.
