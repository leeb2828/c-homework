<span>1.</span>Write a program that calculates how many digits a number contains:<br />
    <pre>
      Enter a number: 374
      The number 374 has 3 digits
    </pre>
    You may assume that the number has no more than four digits. Hint: Use if statements to test the number.
    For example, if the number is between 0 and 9, it has one digit. If the number is between 10 and 99, it has two digits.

<span>2.</span>Write a program that asks the user for a 24-hour time, then displays the time in 12-hour form:
    <pre>Enter a 24-hour time: 21:11
         Equivalent 12-hour time: 9:11
    </pre>
    Be careful not to display 12:00 as 0:00

<br />

<span>9.</span>Write a program that prompts the user to enter two dates and then indicates which date comes earlier
    on the calender:<br />
    Enter the first date (mm/dd/yy): 3/6/08<br />
    Enter second date (mm/dd/yy): 5/17/07<br />
    5/17/07 is earlier than 3/6/08

<br />

<span>10.</span>Using a switch statement, write a program that converts a numerical grade into a letter grade:<br />
    Enter numerical grade: 84<br />
    Letter grade: B<br />
    Hint: Break the number into two digits. Use one switch statement to print the word for the first digit("twenty", "thirty" and so forth).
    Use a second switch statement to print the word for the second digit. Don't forget that the numbers between 11 and 19 require special
    treatment.
